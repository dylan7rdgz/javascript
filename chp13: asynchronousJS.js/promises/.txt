Dear Careers Team,

I am Dylan Rodrigues. 

I have pursued MEng in Computer Vision and AI during the academic year 2024-2025. My Student Id is 24121479.

At the moment, I am not in Ireland and would return on 25th October.

During the month of September, graduate recruitment is very active and I wonder if I 
might miss out on this unless I am able to apply and give interviews onlin.  Coiuld you please advise if online
application and interview is possible? If not, would you be able to suggest alternatives ?

Further, I a not sure whther i need to be physically present in Ireland in order to 'apply' for the 1G Visa ?
Can I apply for it online? I understand, I need to be physically present for a visa interview if required, 
and to collect the visa. But I am not sure whether I just 'apply' for it, while I am outside of Ireland. Would you be able 
to advise me on thid matter?

A related question I have is whether a 'pending' stamp 1G Visa is good enough to apply for software jobs in Ireland or 
do I need to hold the stamp 1G in order to apply.

Finally, would you be able to confirm when I would get the degree certificatation of course completion at UL.


At what date would I get a certificate stating that I have completed my course/degree at UL?
Can I complete the entire process to get the stamp 1G Visa online?
If it is not possible to complete the entire process for stamp1G Visa online, can I at least book an appointment online for the first in-person visit to the immigration center?
Do I need a stamp 1G at the time of applying for a Job?

Thanks & Regards,
Dylan Rodrigues
